	abstract = {Pervasive computing is beginning to offer the potential to rethink and redefine how technology can support human memory augmentation. For example, the emergence of widespread pervasive sensing, personal recording technologies, and systems for the quantified self are creating an environment in which it's possible to capture fine-grained traces of many aspects of human activity. Contemporary psychology theories suggest that these traces can then be used to manipulate our ability to recall–to both reinforce and attenuate human memories. Here, the authors consider the privacy and security implications of using pervasive computing to augment human memory. They describe a number of scenarios, outline the key architectural building blocks, and identify entirely new types of security and privacy threats-namely, those related to data security (experience provenance), data management (establishing new paradigms for digital memory ownership), data integrity (memory attenuation and recall-induced forgetting), and bystander privacy. Together, these threats present compelling research challenges for the pervasive computing research community. This article is part of a special issue on privacy and security.},

	abstract = {Technology has always had a direct impact on what humans remember. In the era of smartphones and wearable devices, people easily capture information, such as pictures and videos, on a daily basis. The so-called "quantified self" movement focuses on using such captured multimedia information, often in combination with additional contextual data (such as GPS traces or social media posts), with the goal of extracting and providing better insights into people's everyday actions (for example, fitness tracking, work productivity, and dieting). However, a more interesting use of such captured data might be to directly support human memory. Here, the authors describe their efforts in the EU Recall project to extract memory cues from multimedia records to augment human memory beyond simple memory prosthetics.},
